# Data Mining and Business Intellegence
## Property-Business-Decision-Mining

In this case study, I aim to provide information relevant to the inquiries of the manager:

1. Data Quality of the Company
2. Recommendations for Data Improvement to DE/DBA
3. Trends in Housing Prices Among Cities
4. Recommendations for Next Branch Location:
5. Most Sold House Characteristics
6. Investment Recommendations within a Budget of Rp25 Billion
7. If RPPI intends to invest a maximum of Rp25 billion next week, leverage the data to recommend houses that have the potential to yield profits for the company.
8. Uncovering Additional Valuable Information from the Data

**Insight**
1. The data held by PT Ray Pink Property Indonesia (RPPI) exhibits several shortcomings:\
   a. Missing Values:\
      All variables in the dataset contain missing values, with the highest counts as follows:\
      "hadap" variable: 1624 missing data\
      "garasi" variable: 1049 missing data\
      "carport" variable: 545 missing data\
      "listrik" variable: 225 missing data\
   b. Duplicate Data:\
      There are 14 instances of duplicate data.\
   c. Outliers:\
      Numerous outliers are present in the dataset.\
   d. Inconsistent Data Types:\
      The variables LT, LB, KT, and KM, which should have integer data types, are currently classified as object data types.\
   e. Inconsistency in Variable Values:\
      Inconsistencies are observed in the 'harga' variable, where values are sometimes prefixed with "RP," "Rp," or directly stated.\
Despite these challenges, we believe that the existing variables are reasonably adequate for representing the characteristics of houses in each region. Addressing the data quality issues outlined above will be crucial for enhancing the reliability and usability of the dataset.\
2. The region with generally lower housing prices is Bekasi. Conversely, the region with generally higher housing prices is Jakarta. This is evident in the box plot above, which illustrates a diverse distribution of house prices in Jakarta, surpassing the average prices observed in other regions.
3. We recommend to PT Ray Pink Property Indonesia (RPPI) to consider opening a branch in Bogor City. This recommendation is based on the fact that Bogor City has the highest number of sales advertisements, indicating a substantial market potential in the city. As an alternative suggestion, we recommend PT Ray Pink Property Indonesia (RPPI) to explore the option of opening a branch in Medan City. This recommendation is supported by the observation that the largest total sales are recorded in Medan City, implying a potential for high revenue in this location.
4. Characteristics of Houses that Are Likely to be Listed for Sale:\
   a. Houses with 2 Bedrooms (KT) are anticipated to be listed for sale.\
   b. Houses with 2 Bathrooms (KM) are expected to be featured in upcoming listings.\
   c. Properties with 1 carport are likely to be put on the market.\
   d. Homes with Freehold Ownership Certificate (SHM) are anticipated to be among the listings.\
   e. Properties with electrical power ranging between 1300-2200 are indicative of houses in the lower to mid-range category that are likely to be offered for sale.
5. Houses with the potential to generate profits for the company are those with large land and building areas but are priced relatively low. Thus, it is evident that the most recommended house for investment, with the potential to yield profits for the company, is located in the Cempaka Putih area, Central Jakarta. Details for other houses can be referenced in the table above.
6. The city of Jakarta exhibits a tendency towards higher housing prices. The most expensive house in Jakarta is priced at 31,346,153.846153848 per square meter. This property features 4 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, 1 garage, and 1 carport.
